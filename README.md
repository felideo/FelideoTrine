FelideoTrine - QueryBuilder provide simple methods to construct MySQL queries and returning result into a hierarchical tree

## About

Why another query builder?
* Because I think MySQL syntax very bad.
* Because I try a lot other query builder, orms or similar, and anyone return result of queries in a hierarchical tree (if you know anyone, please, talk me).
* Because I don't like any other query builder, orm or similar methods.
* Because I like Doctrine query builder methods, I like how result is presented in hierarchical tree, but Doctrine is very big, with a lot things I not use, I wont know how use and I not insert in my project a package with 10 or 15 mb unnecessary.
* Finally, because I want a tiny, simple and effective query builder, that return query results in a hierarchical tree.

## Install
* composer require felideotrine/query-builder
